# My small portfolio website
## Built with React and MDL

This is my small portfolio website that I decided to make for learning purposes using React and MDL components.

To start your first react app use: [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I have used mostly the official MDL documentation: https://tleunen.github.io/react-mdl/
